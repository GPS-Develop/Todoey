// Items also subclassing the realm object, and that allows them to be saved using realm as well. It has three properties, a title, whether if it was done or not. And also, now it has a date created, property. And finally, we specify the inverse relationship that links each item back to a parent category. And we specify the type of the destination of the link. And we also specify the property name of the inverse relationship. And that relates to this property.
